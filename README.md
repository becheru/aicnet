# Augemented Iteracted Contract Net (AICNET) Experimentation System

An experimentation platform for negotiation protocols in a  Freight Transport Multi Agent System.

As per current development we are offering two negotiation protocols:
- Iterated Contract Net (ICNET)
- Augmented Iterated Contract Net (AICNET)

## Prerequisites

The Experimental System (ES) was developed in Python 3, through the help of [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [IPython](https://ipython.org/). We recommed using the ES in an IPython/Jupyter interface, as it facilitates experimentation.

The ES is dependent on the following standard Python3 libraries:
- os, for file operations.
- random, for generating pseudo-random numbers.
- copy, for object manipulation operations.

The ES is dependent on the following external Python3 libraries:
- [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/index.html), for graph related operations.
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), for plotting operations.
- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/), for statistics operations.

## Running the experiments

Just copy/download/replicate the code in your Python IDE, then run it. The results of the experiments largely depend on the _environment variables_, which we recommend playing with before running the experiment.
